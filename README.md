## Description

This is a school project. Where the task was to use bootstrap and sass to build an application for social media. the pages we were going to include were:
Authentication page (/index.html)
Feed Page (/feed/index.html)
Profile page (/profile/index.html)

I chose to create an application for training, where you can post your sessions and share them with your friends.
